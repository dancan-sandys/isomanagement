# Decision Tree Justification Field Removal Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Task:** Remove justification fields from decision tree questions in hazard analysis

## Changes Made

### File: `frontend/src/components/HACCP/HazardDialog.tsx`

#### 1. Removed Justification TextField (Line 1321-1330)
**Before:**
```tsx
<TextField
  fullWidth
  multiline
  rows={3}
  label="Justification"
  placeholder="Provide justification for your answer..."
  value={currentQuestionJustification}
  onChange={(e) => setCurrentQuestionJustification(e.target.value)}
  sx={{ mb: 2 }}
/>
```

**After:**
```tsx
// Removed - No justification input field
```

#### 2. Removed State Variable (Line 172)
**Before:**
```tsx
const [currentQuestionJustification, setCurrentQuestionJustification] = useState('');
```

**After:**
```tsx
// Removed - State variable no longer needed
```

#### 3. Updated DecisionTreeAnswers Interface (Lines 83-89)
**Before:**
```tsx
interface DecisionTreeAnswers {
  q1_answer?: boolean;
  q1_justification?: string;
  q2_answer?: boolean;
  q2_justification?: string;
  q3_answer?: boolean;
  q3_justification?: string;
  q4_answer?: boolean;
  q4_justification?: string;
  q5_answer?: boolean;
  q5_justification?: string;
}
```

**After:**
```tsx
interface DecisionTreeAnswers {
  q1_answer?: boolean;
  q2_answer?: boolean;
  q3_answer?: boolean;
  q4_answer?: boolean;
  q5_answer?: boolean;
}
```

#### 4. Cleaned Up Answer Handling Function
**Before:**
```tsx
const handleDecisionTreeAnswer = (answer: boolean) => {
  const questionKey = `q${currentQuestion + 1}_answer` as keyof DecisionTreeAnswers;
  const justificationKey = `q${currentQuestion + 1}_justification` as keyof DecisionTreeAnswers;

  const newAnswers = {
    ...decisionTreeAnswers,
    [questionKey]: answer,
    [justificationKey]: currentQuestionJustification,  // ❌ Stored justification
  };
  
  setDecisionTreeAnswers(newAnswers);
  // ...
}
```

**After:**
```tsx
const handleDecisionTreeAnswer = (answer: boolean) => {
  const questionKey = `q${currentQuestion + 1}_answer` as keyof DecisionTreeAnswers;

  const newAnswers = {
    ...decisionTreeAnswers,
    [questionKey]: answer,  // ✅ Only stores answer
  };
  
  setDecisionTreeAnswers(newAnswers);
  // ...
}
```

#### 5. Removed All Justification Resets
Updated all state reset locations to remove `setCurrentQuestionJustification('')`:
- Strategy change initialization
- After each decision
- Dialog close handlers
- Question transitions

## Decision Tree Questions (Unchanged)

The 5 questions remain the same:

1. **Q1:** Based on the Risk Assessment (RA), is this hazard significant (needs to be controlled)?
2. **Q2:** Will a subsequent processing step, including expected use by consumer, guarantee the removal of this Significant Hazard, or its reduction to an acceptable level?
3. **Q3:** Are there control measures or practices in place at this step, and do they exclude, reduce or maintain this Significant Hazard to/at an acceptable level?
4. **Q4:** Is it possible to establish critical limits for the control measure at this step?
5. **Q5:** Is it possible to monitor the control measure in such a way that corrective actions can be taken immediately when there is a loss of control?

## User Experience

### Before:
```
Question → Answer (Yes/No) → Justification TextField (Required) → Next
```

### After:
```
Question → Answer (Yes/No) → Next
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Faster decision tree completion
- ✅ Cleaner, more focused UI
- ✅ Reduced cognitive load on users
- ✅ Automatic risk strategy justification still provided
- ✅ Q2 still requires subsequent step name input (when answering Yes)

---

## What Still Works

1. **Automatic Justification Generation**
   - The system still auto-generates justification based on the decision path
   - Stored in `formData.risk_strategy_justification`
   
2. **Subsequent Step Tracking**
   - Q2 still shows the "Subsequent Step Name" input when needed
   - Required for documenting which step controls the hazard

3. **Risk Strategy Justification**
   - After decision tree completes, users can still edit the overall justification
   - Field remains in the main hazard form (line 1055-1065)

---

## Impact

### Removed:
- ❌ Individual justification TextField for each question
- ❌ `currentQuestionJustification` state variable
- ❌ `q*_justification` fields from DecisionTreeAnswers interface

### Retained:
- ✅ All 5 decision tree questions
- ✅ Yes/No answer buttons
- ✅ Help text for each question
- ✅ Subsequent step name input (Q2)
- ✅ Overall risk strategy justification field
- ✅ Automatic justification generation

---

## Testing

No backend changes required. Test the decision tree:

1. Create or edit a hazard
2. Select "Further Analysis (Decision Tree)" as risk strategy
3. Answer questions - verify no justification fields appear
4. Verify subsequent step input still appears for Q2 when answering "Yes"
5. Complete the tree - verify automatic justification is generated
6. Save and verify hazard is created correctly
