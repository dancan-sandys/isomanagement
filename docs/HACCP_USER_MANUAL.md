## Hazard Analysis

### Conducting Hazard Analysis

1. **Identify Hazards**: List all potential hazards for the product
2. **Hazard Types**:
   - **Biological**: Bacteria, viruses, parasites
   - **Chemical**: Pesticides, cleaning chemicals, allergens
   - **Physical**: Metal fragments, glass, plastic

3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - **Likelihood**: Probability of occurrence (1-5 scale)
   - **Severity**: Potential impact if hazard occurs (1-5 scale)
   - **Risk Score**: Likelihood × Severity
   - **Risk Level**: Low, Medium, High, Critical

4. **CCP Determination**: Use decision tree to determine if control point is a CCP

### Decision Tree Process

The system includes an interactive decision tree based on Codex Alimentarius:

1. **Question 1**: Do control measures exist for the identified hazard?
2. **Question 2**: Is the step specifically designed to eliminate or reduce the likelihood of occurrence of the hazard to an acceptable level?
3. **Question 3**: Could contamination with the identified hazard occur or could it increase to an unacceptable level?
4. **Question 4**: Will a subsequent step eliminate or reduce the likelihood of occurrence of the hazard to an acceptable level?

### Documentation Requirements

For each hazard, document:
- Hazard description and type
- Risk assessment rationale
- Control measures
- CCP determination justification
- Monitoring requirements

## Critical Control Points (CCPs)
