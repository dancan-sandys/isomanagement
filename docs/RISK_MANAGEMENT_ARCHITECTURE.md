# Risk Management Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the risk management architecture for the ISO 22000:2018 Food Safety Management System, explaining how risks are managed at different levels and how the PRP module integrates with the main risk register.

## Risk Management Hierarchy

### 1. Strategic Level (Risk Module)
**Purpose:** Enterprise-wide risk management and strategic decision making

**Risk Categories:**
- **Strategic Risks** - Business strategy, market changes, competition
- **Financial Risks** - Budget, cost overruns, financial performance
- **Compliance Risks** - Regulatory non-compliance, legal issues
- **Reputational Risks** - Brand damage, customer trust
- **Business Continuity Risks** - System failures, disasters
- **Overall FSMS Risks** - Food safety management system effectiveness

**Key Features:**
- Risk tolerance levels
- Risk appetite statements
- Strategic risk mitigation
- Board-level reporting
- Resource allocation decisions

### 2. Operational Level (PRP Module)
**Purpose:** Process-specific risk assessment and operational control

**Risk Categories:**
- **Facility Design Risks** - Building layout, equipment placement
- **Equipment Risks** - Maintenance, calibration, breakdowns
- **Sanitation Risks** - Cleaning procedures, contamination
- **Pest Control Risks** - Infestation, control measures
- **Personnel Risks** - Training, hygiene, competence
- **Supplier Risks** - Quality, reliability, compliance
- **Process Risks** - Operational procedures, deviations

**Key Features:**
- Detailed hazard identification
- Process-specific controls
- Operational risk scoring
- Immediate action triggers
- Process improvement tracking

## Integration Architecture

### Risk Escalation Flow

```
PRP Risk Assessment → Risk Evaluation → Escalation Decision → Risk Register Entry
```

1. **PRP Risk Assessment**
   - Identify operational hazards
   - Assess likelihood and severity
   - Determine risk level
   - Implement operational controls

2. **Risk Evaluation**
   - Evaluate against escalation criteria
   - Consider strategic impact
   - Assess resource requirements
   - Determine escalation need

3. **Escalation Decision**
   - High/Critical risks automatically flagged
   - Medium risks reviewed for escalation
   - Low/Very Low risks remain operational

4. **Risk Register Entry**
   - Create strategic risk entry
   - Link to PRP assessment
   - Assign strategic ownership
   - Track strategic mitigation

### Escalation Criteria

**Automatic Escalation:**
- Risk Level: HIGH, VERY_HIGH, CRITICAL
- Cross-functional impact
- Regulatory compliance issues
- Resource requirements > $10,000
- Timeline impact > 30 days

**Manual Review:**
- Risk Level: MEDIUM
- Department head approval required
- Strategic impact assessment
- Resource allocation review

**Operational Management:**
- Risk Level: LOW, VERY_LOW
- Managed within PRP program
- Regular monitoring and review
- Process improvement focus

## Data Model Integration

### PRP Risk Assessment → Risk Register

```python
# PRP Risk Assessment
class RiskAssessment:
    risk_register_entry_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("risk_register_items.id"))
    escalated_to_risk_register = Column(Boolean, default=False)
    escalation_date = Column(DateTime)
    escalated_by = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))

# Risk Register Entry
class RiskRegisterItem:
    source = Column(String(50))  # "prp_assessment"
    source_id = Column(Integer)  # RiskAssessment.id
    risk_type = Column(String(50))  # "operational"
```

### Category Mapping

| PRP Category | Risk Register Category | Risk Type |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Facility Design | Operational | Facility |
| Equipment | Operational | Equipment |
| Sanitation | Operational | Process |
| Pest Control | Operational | Process |
| Personnel | Operational | People |
| Supplier Control | Supplier | External |
| Food Defense | Security | Security |
| Compliance | Compliance | Regulatory |

1. **Operational risks** are properly managed within PRP programs
2. **Strategic risks** are escalated and managed at the enterprise level
3. **Risk information** flows seamlessly between levels
4. **Resources** are allocated appropriately based on risk impact
5. **Continuous improvement** is supported at all levels

The architecture supports both current operational needs and future strategic growth while maintaining compliance with international food safety standards.
