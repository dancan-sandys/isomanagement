### HACCP implementation hardening checklist (FDA/FSIS/ISO 22000 aligned)

This checklist closes the identified gaps in the current HACCP module and ensures an efficient, compliant end-to-end process across backend and frontend. Complete each section in order. Track status with the checkboxes.

#### Legend
- [ ] = To do, [x] = Done
- Artifacts: files, endpoints, UI views to be created/updated
- Acceptance: concrete acceptance criteria

### 1) Governance, roles, and access control
- [x] Define HACCP roles and responsibilities (Operators, QA Verifier, QA Manager, Approver) and map to `rbac` roles.
  - Artifacts: `backend/app/core/permissions.py`, role seeds, documentation
  - Acceptance: Only permitted roles can create hazards/CCPs, log monitoring, verify, and approve plans.
- [x] Enforce permissions in HACCP endpoints (create/update/delete, approve/verify).
  - Artifacts: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/haccp.py`
  - Acceptance: All sensitive endpoints validate role; unauthorized calls return 403.
- [x] Integrate training/competency checks for monitoring and verification.
  - Artifacts: `backend/app/models/training.py`, usage in endpoints/services
  - Acceptance: Users without required competency cannot log monitoring or verification.
- [x] Action-specific competency policy (monitor vs verify) and optional CCP/equipment-specific requirements.
  - Artifacts: DB migration to extend `role_required_trainings` with `action` (enum: monitor|verify) or new table `haccp_required_trainings(role_id, action, ccp_id|equipment_id, program_id)`; service updates.
  - Acceptance: Policy can target action and optionally CCP/equipment; enforcement prefers specific policy over role-wide; unit tests cover cases.
- [x] Admin eligibility endpoints for visibility and audits.
  - Artifacts: `GET /training/matrix/{user_id}` (admin view of any user); `GET /training/eligibility?user_id=&action=&ccp_id=&equipment_id=` returning `{ eligible, missing_program_ids }`.
  - Acceptance: Admin can query any user’s eligibility and see missing trainings; responses are fast and paginated where needed.
- [x] User Management UI: Training & Competency management.
  - Artifacts: Update `frontend/src/pages/Users.tsx` with a dialog/tab to view a selected user’s training matrix, eligibility badges for monitor/verify, and list missing trainings; actions to assign required trainings.
  - Acceptance: Admin can view eligibility at a glance and assign requirements without leaving the page; changes reflect immediately.
- [x] Add role-required training assignment in dialog and a simple admin view for role requirements.
  - Artifacts: In `Users.tsx` competency dialog: list role-required trainings for the user’s role, add/select program, delete entries; Admin tab to list and manage role-required records.
  - Acceptance: Admin can add/remove role-required training quickly; list refreshes without page reload.
- [x] Enrich role-required list to show program code/title instead of IDs.
  - Artifacts: Join against program list in `Users.tsx` and render `code — title`.
  - Acceptance: UI shows human-readable program names in the role-required table.
- [x] Scoped requirement assignment controls (monitor/verify + optional CCP/equipment) in Users dialog.
  - Artifacts: Add action selector and optional CCP/equipment pickers; call `/training/required/haccp` endpoints.
  - Acceptance: Admin can assign/remove scoped requirements from within the dialog; selections persist.
- [x] Role-required training configuration UI (with action and optional CCP/equipment scoping).
  - Artifacts: Admin view under Training to add/list/remove required trainings (uses `/training/required` and new action/scoping fields).
  - Acceptance: Policies are persisted and visible; duplicates prevented; audit logs captured.

### 2) Product, process flow, and batch integration
- [x] Ensure `ProcessFlow` fully represents actual flow; require at least one step.
  - Acceptance: Cannot approve HACCP plan if no flow exists.
- [x] Link monitoring logs to `Traceability.Batch` via `batch_id` (not free-text only).
  - Artifacts: DB migration, model field addition; keep `batch_number` for legacy display.
  - Acceptance: Monitoring logs must reference a valid batch; UI allows selecting a batch.

### 3) Hazard analysis (Principle 1)
- [x] Standardize hazard analysis data capture (rationale, PRP reliance, references).
  - Artifacts: Extend `Hazard` model/schema with `rationale`, `prp_reference_ids`, `references`.

  - Artifacts: `HazardReview` model, API endpoints, review criteria tracking.
  - Acceptance: Hazard reviews track identification, risk assessment, control measures, and CCP determination; product-level review status endpoint available.
- [x] **CRITICAL: Restructure risk assessment to be ISO 22000/HACCP compliant (product-specific, not global).**
  - **Issue:** Current global risk thresholds violate ISO 22000 principles. Risk assessment must be product-specific and integrated with hazard analysis.
  - **Artifacts:** ✅ Added `ProductRiskConfig` model; ✅ Updated HACCP service to use product-specific risk calculation; ✅ Created database migration; ✅ Updated models imports.
  - **Acceptance:** Each product has its own risk configuration; risk calculation happens during hazard creation/editing; no global risk thresholds; fully compliant with ISO 22000 Clause 8.5.2-8.5.4.
