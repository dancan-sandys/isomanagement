  - Artifacts: `backend/app/models/training.py`, usage in endpoints/services
  - Acceptance: Users without required competency cannot log monitoring or verification.
- [x] Action-specific competency policy (monitor vs verify) and optional CCP/equipment-specific requirements.
  - Artifacts: DB migration to extend `role_required_trainings` with `action` (enum: monitor|verify) or new table `haccp_required_trainings(role_id, action, ccp_id|equipment_id, program_id)`; service updates.
  - Acceptance: Policy can target action and optionally CCP/equipment; enforcement prefers specific policy over role-wide; unit tests cover cases.
- [x] Admin eligibility endpoints for visibility and audits.
  - Artifacts: `GET /training/matrix/{user_id}` (admin view of any user); `GET /training/eligibility?user_id=&action=&ccp_id=&equipment_id=` returning `{ eligible, missing_program_ids }`.
  - Acceptance: Admin can query any user’s eligibility and see missing trainings; responses are fast and paginated where needed.
- [x] User Management UI: Training & Competency management.
  - Artifacts: Update `frontend/src/pages/Users.tsx` with a dialog/tab to view a selected user’s training matrix, eligibility badges for monitor/verify, and list missing trainings; actions to assign required trainings.
  - Acceptance: Admin can view eligibility at a glance and assign requirements without leaving the page; changes reflect immediately.
- [x] Add role-required training assignment in dialog and a simple admin view for role requirements.
  - Artifacts: In `Users.tsx` competency dialog: list role-required trainings for the user’s role, add/select program, delete entries; Admin tab to list and manage role-required records.
