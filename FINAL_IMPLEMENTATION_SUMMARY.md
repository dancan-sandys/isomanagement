# âœ… HACCP Risk Strategy Implementation - FINAL SUMMARY

## ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Complete and Production Ready

All requirements have been successfully implemented with CCP/OPRP creation forms integrated into the hazard creation flow.

---

## Complete User Flow

### 1. Basic Hazard Information
User fills in:
- Process Step (required)
- Hazard Type (required)
- Hazard Name (required)  
- Description
- Consequences
- References (optional, multiple)

### 2. Risk Assessment
User enters:
- Likelihood (1-5)
- Severity (1-5)

System automatically:
- Calculates Risk Score (Likelihood Ã— Severity)
- Determines Risk Level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
- Recommends Risk Strategy (OPRP for LOW/MEDIUM, Further Analysis for HIGH/CRITICAL)

User fills in:
- Existing Control Measures

### 3. Risk Strategy Selection
User selects one of three options:
- **OPRP** (direct selection)
- **CCP** (direct selection)
- **Further Analysis** (opens 5-question decision tree)

### 4. Decision Tree (if "Further Analysis" selected)

**Q1:** Based on the Risk Assessment (RA), is this hazard significant (needs to be controlled)?
- NO â†’ Strategy = OPRP, Dialog closes
- YES â†’ Continue to Q2

**Q2:** Will a subsequent processing step, including expected use by consumer, guarantee the removal of this Significant Hazard, or its reduction to an acceptable level?
- YES â†’ User enters "Subsequent Step Name" â†’ Strategy = OPRP, Dialog closes
- NO â†’ Continue to Q3

**Q3:** Are there control measures or practices in place at this step, and do they exclude, reduce or maintain this Significant Hazard to/at an acceptable level?
- NO â†’ Alert shown, Dialog closes
- YES â†’ Continue to Q4

**Q4:** Is it possible to establish critical limits for the control measure at this step?
- NO â†’ Strategy = OPRP, Dialog closes
- YES â†’ Continue to Q5

**Q5:** Is it possible to monitor the control measure in such a way that corrective actions can be taken immediately when there is a loss of control?
- YES â†’ Strategy = CCP, Dialog closes
- NO â†’ Strategy = OPRP, Dialog closes

Each question requires justification.

### 5. Strategy Locked & Justification
After strategy is determined:
- âœ… Strategy displays in green success alert
- âœ… "Change" button available to reset
- âœ… Justification field appears:
  - **Required** if decision tree was used
  - **Optional** if manually selected
  - Auto-populated from decision tree logic (can be edited)

### 6. CCP/OPRP Creation Form Appears

#### If Strategy = CCP:
Form shows with fields:
- **CCP Number** (required, auto-suggested)
- **CCP Name** (required, auto-filled from hazard name)
- **Description** (auto-filled, editable)
- **Critical Limit Min** (optional)
- **Critical Limit Max** (optional)
- **Unit** (optional)
- **Monitoring Frequency** (optional)
- **Monitoring Method** (optional)
- **Corrective Actions** (optional)

#### If Strategy = OPRP:
Form shows with fields:
- **OPRP Number** (required, auto-suggested)
- **OPRP Name** (required, auto-filled from hazard name)
- **Description** (auto-filled, editable)
- **Objective** (optional)
- **SOP Reference** (optional)

### 7. Save
- Button text changes to "Save Hazard & CCP" or "Save Hazard & OPRP"
- Validation ensures all required fields are filled
- Single save operation creates both hazard and CCP/OPRP

### 8. Backend Processing
- Creates Hazard record with all data
- Stores decision tree answers (if applicable)
- Creates CCP record (if strategy = CCP) with form data
- Creates OPRP record (if strategy = OPRP) with form data
- Both CCP/OPRP are automatically linked to the hazard (hazard_id)

### 9. Success Message
User sees: "Hazard created successfully and CCP (CCP-1-42) created" (or OPRP)

## What's Different from Previous Version

### Previous Auto-Create Approach:
- Hazard saved first
- Simple CCP/OPRP auto-created with minimal data
- User had to edit CCP/OPRP afterward to add details

### Current Integrated Approach:
- **Hazard AND CCP/OPRP created together**
- **Complete CCP/OPRP data collected upfront**
- **Single save operation**
- **No need for post-edit** (though user can still edit later)
- **Both records linked automatically via hazard_id**
