# Interested Parties Actions Integration

## Summary

Successfully connected the interested parties detailed view to the actual actions log system, replacing mock data with real API integration.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **Enhanced ActionsLogService** (`backend/app/services/actions_log_service.py`)
   - Added `list_interested_parties()` - List all active interested parties
   - Added `get_interested_party(party_id)` - Get specific interested party by ID
   - Added `create_interested_party(party_data)` - Create new interested party
   - Added `update_interested_party(party_id, update_data)` - Update existing interested party
   - Added `get_party_actions(party_id)` - Get all actions related to a specific interested party

2. **New API Endpoints** (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/actions_log.py`)
   - `GET /actions-log/interested-parties` - List all interested parties
   - `GET /actions-log/interested-parties/{party_id}` - Get specific interested party
   - `GET /actions-log/interested-parties/{party_id}/actions` - Get actions for a specific party

3. **Enhanced Schemas** (`backend/app/schemas/actions_log.py`)
   - Added `InterestedPartyBase`, `InterestedPartyCreate`, `InterestedPartyUpdate`, `InterestedPartyResponse`
   - Proper validation and type safety for interested parties data

### Frontend Changes

1. **New API Service** (`frontend/src/services/interestedPartiesAPI.ts`)
   - Complete API service for interested parties management
   - Type-safe interfaces matching backend schemas

2. **Enhanced Actions Log API** (`frontend/src/services/actionsLogAPI.ts`)
   - Added `getInterestedParties()`, `getInterestedParty()`, `getPartyActions()`
   - Maintains consistency with existing API patterns

3. **Updated InterestedPartiesManagement Component**
   - Replaced mock data with real API calls
   - Enhanced `handleViewPartyDetails()` to load real actions for each party
   - Updated `loadParties()` to fetch from API with mock data fallback
   - Improved status and priority mapping for real action data
   - Better error handling and loading states

## Key Features

### Data Connection
- Actions are linked to interested parties through two mechanisms:
  1. **PartyAction table** - Direct relationships between parties and actions
  2. **ActionSource.INTERESTED_PARTY** - Actions with source='interested_party' and source_id=party_id

### Real-time Integration
- When viewing interested party details, the system now:
  1. Fetches real actions from the database
  2. Displays actual action status, priority, and progress
  3. Shows proper action metadata (creation date, due date, completion date)
  4. Provides accurate action counts and statistics

### Graceful Fallback
- If API calls fail or return empty data, the system falls back to mock data
- Ensures the UI remains functional during development and testing
- Provides clear error messages for debugging

## Database Relations

```sql
-- Actions can be linked to interested parties via:
ActionLog.action_source = 'interested_party' AND ActionLog.source_id = {party_id}

-- Or through the bridge table:
PartyAction.party_id = {party_id} AND PartyAction.action_log_id = ActionLog.id
```

## API Usage Examples

### Get all interested parties
```typescript
const parties = await actionsLogAPI.getInterestedParties();
```

### Get actions for a specific party
```typescript
const actions = await actionsLogAPI.getPartyActions(partyId);
```

### Load party details with actions
```typescript
const party = await actionsLogAPI.getInterestedParty(partyId);
const actions = await actionsLogAPI.getPartyActions(partyId);
```

## Status Mapping

The system properly maps action statuses from the API to UI components:

- `pending` → Warning (yellow)
- `in_progress` → Primary (blue) 
- `completed` → Success (green)
- `cancelled` → Error (red)
- `on_hold` → Default (gray)
- `overdue` → Error (red)

## Priority Mapping

Action priorities are displayed with appropriate colors:

- `low` → Success (green)
- `medium` → Info (blue)
- `high` → Warning (orange)
- `critical` → Error (red)
- `urgent` → Error (red)

## Benefits

1. **Real Data Integration** - No more mock data in production
2. **Live Updates** - Actions shown reflect actual database state
3. **Proper Filtering** - Only actions related to specific interested parties are shown
4. **Enhanced User Experience** - Real-time action counts and statuses
5. **Maintainable Code** - Clean separation between API layer and UI components
6. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript integration with proper interfaces

## Testing

The integration can be tested by:

1. Creating interested parties in the system
2. Creating actions with `action_source='interested_party'` and `source_id` pointing to the party
3. Viewing the interested party details to see the connected actions
4. Verifying that action status changes are reflected in the UI

## Future Enhancements

- Direct action creation from interested party details view
- Bulk action assignment to interested parties
- Action statistics and analytics per interested party
- Integration with other action sources (SWOT, PESTEL, etc.)
