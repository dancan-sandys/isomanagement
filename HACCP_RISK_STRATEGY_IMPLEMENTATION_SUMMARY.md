# HACCP Risk Strategy Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive re-orchestration of the HACCP hazard creation process to align with ISO 22000 standards and implement a risk strategy-based approach with decision tree analysis.

## Key Features

### New Decision Tree Questions (ISO 22000 Compliant)

The system now uses the following 5-question decision tree:

**Q1:** Based on the Risk Assessment (RA), is this hazard significant (needs to be controlled)?
- **YES:** Proceed to Q2
- **NO:** Not a significant hazard (OPRP)

**Q2:** Will a subsequent processing step, including expected use by consumer, guarantee the removal of this Significant Hazard, or its reduction to an acceptable level?
- **YES:** Subsequent step controls (OPRP) - User must name the subsequent step
- **NO:** Proceed to Q3

**Q3:** Are there control measures or practices in place at this step, and do they exclude, reduce or maintain this Significant Hazard to/at an acceptable level?
- **YES:** Proceed to Q4
- **NO:** Modify the process or product and return to Q1

**Q4:** Is it possible to establish critical limits for the control measure at this step?
- **YES:** Proceed to Q5
- **NO:** Managed by OPRP

**Q5:** Is it possible to monitor the control measure in such a way that corrective actions can be taken immediately when there is a loss of control?
- **YES:** Managed by HACCP-plan (CCP)
- **NO:** Managed by OPRP

### Automatic CCP/OPRP Creation

When a hazard is saved with risk_strategy set to `CCP` or `OPRP`, the system automatically creates:
- **CCP:** Auto-generates CCP-{product_id}-{hazard_id}
- **OPRP:** Auto-generates OPRP-{product_id}-{hazard_id}

This ensures consistent tracking and eliminates the need for manual CCP/OPRP creation.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### 1.1 Updated `backend/app/services/haccp_service.py`

**Changes to `create_hazard` method:**
- Added auto-determination of `risk_strategy` based on `risk_level`:
  - **LOW risk** → Defaults to `OPRP` (Operational Prerequisite Program)
  - **MEDIUM risk** → Defaults to `OPRP`
  - **HIGH risk** → Defaults to `FURTHER_ANALYSIS`
  - **CRITICAL risk** → Defaults to `FURTHER_ANALYSIS`
- User can override the auto-determined strategy
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing fields (`is_controlled`, `control_effectiveness`, `is_ccp`) with sensible defaults

**Risk Strategy Logic:**
```python
# Auto-determine risk_strategy based on risk_level if not explicitly provided
from app.models.haccp import RiskStrategy
risk_strategy = hazard_data.risk_strategy
if risk_strategy == RiskStrategy.NOT_DETERMINED or risk_strategy is None:
    if risk_level == RiskLevel.LOW:
        risk_strategy = RiskStrategy.OPPRP
    elif risk_level == RiskLevel.MEDIUM:
        risk_strategy = RiskStrategy.OPPRP
    elif risk_level == RiskLevel.HIGH:
        risk_strategy = RiskStrategy.FURTHER_ANALYSIS
    else:  # CRITICAL
        risk_strategy = RiskStrategy.FURTHER_ANALYSIS
```

#### 1.2 Schemas

**`backend/app/schemas/haccp.py`:**
- `HazardCreate` schema already had optional fields for:
  - `is_controlled: bool = False`
  - `control_effectiveness: Optional[int] = Field(None, ge=1, le=5)`
  - `is_ccp: bool = False`
  - `risk_strategy: Optional[RiskStrategy] = RiskStrategy.NOT_DETERMINED`
- No schema changes were needed as the structure was already suitable

#### 1.3 Decision Tree Model

**`backend/app/models/haccp.py`:**
- `DecisionTree` model already supports 5 questions (Q1-Q5)
- `determine_risk_strategy()` method returns: `(strategy, is_ccp, is_opprp, reasoning)`
- Decision tree logic implements Codex Alimentarius guidelines with ISO 22000 enhancements

**Decision Tree Flow:**
1. **Q1:** Is control at this step necessary for safety?
   - No → Risk Accepted (OPRP)
2. **Q2:** Is control necessary to eliminate or reduce hazard likelihood?
   - No → Risk Accepted (OPRP)
3. **Q3:** Could contamination occur or increase to unacceptable levels?
   - No → Risk Accepted (OPRP)
4. **Q4:** Will a subsequent step eliminate or reduce the hazard?
   - Yes → OPRP
5. **Q5:** Is this control measure preventive or does it significantly reduce the hazard?
   - Yes → OPRP
   - No → CCP

### 2. Frontend Changes

   - When hazard is saved with `OPRP` strategy, automatically creates an OPRP record
   - Auto-generated numbers: `CCP-{product_id}-{hazard_id}` or `OPRP-{product_id}-{hazard_id}`
   - Uses hazard name as CCP/OPRP name
   - Includes justification from risk strategy

6. **Existing Control Measures:**

| MEDIUM (5-8) | OPRP                    | Medium risk can usually be controlled through enhanced PRPs |
| HIGH (9-15) | Further Analysis         | Requires decision tree to determine if CCP or OPRP |
| CRITICAL (16-25) | Further Analysis      | Critical risks need thorough analysis to determine appropriate control |

### 6. Decision Tree Outcomes

| Path | Outcome | Strategy |
|------|---------|----------|
| Q1: No | Control not necessary | OPRP (Risk Accepted) |
| Q2: No | Control not needed to eliminate/reduce | OPRP (Risk Accepted) |
| Q3: No | Contamination unlikely | OPRP (Risk Accepted) |
| Q4: Yes | Subsequent step controls hazard | OPRP |
| Q5: Yes | Preventive control | OPRP |
| Q5: No | Critical control needed | CCP |

### 7. Testing Recommendations

To test the complete flow:

1. **Test Low Risk Hazard:**
   - Set Likelihood = 1, Severity = 2
   - Verify Risk Score = 2, Risk Level = LOW
   - Verify recommended strategy = OPRP
   - Save and verify backend correctly stores data

2. **Test High Risk with Further Analysis:**
   - Set Likelihood = 4, Severity = 4
   - Verify Risk Score = 16, Risk Level = CRITICAL
   - Verify recommended strategy = Further Analysis
   - Select "Further Analysis"
   - Answer all 5 questions
   - Verify final strategy determination (CCP or OPRP)
   - Save and verify decision tree answers are stored

3. **Test Override:**
   - Set any risk level
   - Select different strategy than recommended
   - Verify override is accepted
   - Save and verify correct strategy is stored

4. **Test References:**
   - Add multiple references
   - Edit existing references
   - Delete references
   - Verify all operations work correctly

5. **Test Edit Existing Hazard:**
   - Edit a previously created hazard
   - Verify all fields populate correctly
   - Make changes
   - Verify updates are saved

### 8. Files Modified

**Backend:**
- `backend/app/services/haccp_service.py` (updated `create_hazard` method)

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/components/HACCP/HazardDialog.tsx` (new file, 800+ lines)
- `frontend/src/pages/HACCPProductDetail.tsx` (updated to use new component)

**No files deleted or deprecated.**

### 9. Database Impact

**Database Migration Completed:**
- ✅ Added `risk_strategy_justification` TEXT column to `hazards` table
- ✅ Added `subsequent_step` TEXT column to `hazards` table
- Migration script: `backend/migrations/add_risk_strategy_justification_to_hazards.py`

The database now supports:
- Risk strategy justification storage
- Subsequent step name (from decision tree Q2)
- Decision tree answers storage (JSON)
- Automatic CCP/OPRP creation

### 10. API Impact

**No API changes required.**

The existing API endpoints already support:
- `POST /api/v1/haccp/products/{product_id}/hazards`
- `PUT /api/v1/haccp/hazards/{hazard_id}`
- Decision tree endpoints

The backend service layer handles the auto-determination logic transparently.

## Conclusion
