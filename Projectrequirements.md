	•	Schedule training sessions
	•	Attendance tracking
	•	Post-training quiz with scores
	•	Upload scanned certificates
	•	Generate training matrix per employee
9. Risk & Opportunity Register
	•	Register risks related to processes, suppliers, staff, environment

	•	Evaluate: Severity, Likelihood, Detectability
	•	Mitigation action plans
	•	Monitor implementation
	•	Register opportunities for improvement with tracking
10. Management Review
	•	Template with ISO 22000 inputs:
	•	Internal audit results
	•	Customer feedback
	•	Non-conformities and CAPAs
	•	Monitoring results
	•	FSMS performance and KPIs
